== READ THIS BEFORE YOU DOWNLOAD AND INSTALL ==

I have decided to abandon any further development on this plugin as 
there is now an awesome plugin out by @megainfo on the BuddyPress 
forums that is far more superior called BuddyPress Activity Privacy. 
It does what this plugin could never do, it gives the users a choice 
as to who gets to see an activity post and so much more. So out with
the old and in with the new, get this awesome plugin here:
http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/buddypress-activity-privacy/

For those that are stubborn, I will leave this Jurrassic plugin here 
on github but if you have issues don't request support because I
am using @megainfo 's plugin and you probably should be too!
